PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING IN ADDITION TO THE USUAL DISCLAIMERS THAT
ACCOMPANY FREE SOFTWARE: THE RELEASE OF THIS LIBRARY IN NO WAY IMPLIES
AN ENDORSMENT OF THE PAYMILL PAYMENT SERVICE. BE CAREFUL OUT THERE.

CL-PAYMILL provides an interface to the Paymill payment service API.
You should definitely read their documentation in order to use their
service.  Ie, do NOT just rely on what is written here.  You use this
interface entirely at your own risk, as stated in the licence.  Not
everything in here is robustly tested.

INSTALLING:

cl-paymill requires drakma, st-json and cl+ssl (required for paymill
access).  However, if you use quicklisp, these are automatically
installed for you.

Put cl-paymill in a place where quicklisp
(http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/) can find it, by default
~/quicklisp/local-projects/ Then do:

(ql:quickload :cl-paymill)
(pml:initialize-paymill "your private test key from paymill")

And the package "PAYMILL" (nickname PML) is installed and ready to use.  

USAGE:

PML:INITIALIZE-PAYMILL (KEY)

KEY is a string which is your paymill key, or a symbol with its
symbol-value setf to your key string. This macro defines the access
functions using the provided key. If you called it with a
symbol, you can unbind the symbol afterwards, if you want.  Until you
call this macro with a key, the access functions will not be defined.
If you give it an invalid key all usage will result in access
unathorized errors. Use your test-key, unless you want to get billed
by Paymill.

First some examples, then an explanation: 

To create a new client, without an email or description:
(pml:clients :new)

To create a new client, with an email:
(pml:clients :new :data '(:email "joey@fubar.org"))

To update an existing client's email and description:
(pml:clients :update 
         :id "client_xyz12345" 
         :data '(:email "joe@foo.org" :description "a lousy client"))

You get the client ID as a return value from (pml:clients :new).  See below.


All access has this general form:

PML:RESOURCE (ACCESS-TYPE &KEY [ID] [DATA])

Where RESOURCE is a generic function, ACCESS-TYPE is a keyword,
optional ID is a string, and optional DATA is for all resources
*except WEBHOOKS* (see below), a list (SLOT1 VALUE1 SLOT2 VALUE2 ...)
where SLOTN can be a string or a keyword and VALUEN is a string.  If
SLOTN is a keyword, it is converted to a lowercase string before
sending the request to paymill.  ACCESS-TYPE determines how the
resource should be accessed.  Most resources have ACCESS-TYPES :new,
:retrieve, :list, and :delete.

The possible values for SLOTN depend on the resource which is being
accessed. As you have seen in the examples, CLIENTS have settable
slots "email" and "description". See the Paymill API docs for other
possible values of SLOTN.

For WEBHOOKS, DATA is a list which looks like '(:EMAIL <string email>
((:EVENT1 :STATUS1) (:EVENT2 :STATUS) ...)) OR '(:URL <string url>
((:EVENT1 :STATUS1) (:EVENT2 :STATUS) ...)). All keywords are
converted to downcased strings, and can be replaced by strings in
calls to the resource. See the Paymill API docs for WEBHOOKS for
possible events and statuses.

The return value(s) also depend on ACCESS-TYPE. Accessing a resource
with 

:NEW returns the id of the created object as a first value, and
the actual object (well, actually an st-json representation of it) as
the second value.

:LIST returns a (gasp) list of st-json representations of
the objects of that type.  <Aside: from now on, I am not going to
bother to write 'an st-json representation of ...' You know what I
mean.>

:DELETE returns the object (an st-json rep ...) in the "data" slot
which Paymill returns from the request.  In most cases this is :NULL.
Deleting a CLIENT or a SUBSCRIPTION returns the deleted object.

:RETRIEVE returns the object

:REFUND takes a transaction id and refunds the client the given
amount. It should return the transaction but I can't remember if it
does so - read the Paymill API.  I am not using refunds, so ...

Errors:

If any call to paymill fails to result in a reply with status code
200, an error is signalled. Here are the conditions, exported from
PAYMILL package, together with their status code:

 PAYMILL-BAD-REQUEST 400
 PAYMILL-UNAUTHORIZED 401
 PAYMILL-TRANSACTION-ERROR 403
 PAYMILL-NOT-FOUND 404
 PAYMILL-PRECONDITION-FAILED 412
 PAYMILL-SERVER-ERROR 500 <= status-code <= 505
 PAYMILL-GENERAL-ERROR  other-status-code ~= 200

The error will be signalled from the macro which wraps the actual
request, so don't think you can install an error handler by a :before
method.  Sorry.

The following resources are currently accessible, all exported from
the PAYMILL package:

CLIENTS, TRANSACTIONS, REFUNDS, PAYMENTS, SUBSCRIPTIONS, OFFERS,
WEBHOOKS

Note:

You need to look at st-json as well, but it's nice and simple, and
easy to use.  You might want to build the interface up towards your
app.  For example: define (new-client &optional ...), (new-payment
...) etc.  Thats what I do.  The webhooks interface is new, but tests
suggest it is working.
