Lisp GFlags is a Common Lisp implementation of gflags, Google's command line
flag parsing library.  The library implements functionality similar to that of
Google's C++ and Python gflags libraries, which live here:

    http://code.google.com/p/python-gflags/

The code allows you to define command line flags using the DEFINE-FLAG macro.
For instance, the following form defines a boolean flag called *DEBUG-FLAG*
that is set based on the presence of "--debug" in the application's command
line.

    (define-flag *debug-flag*
      :default-value nil
      :selector "debug"
      :type boolean
      :help "Turn on debugging mode?"
      :documentation "Is debugging mode turned on?")

If the command line contains "--debug" or "--debug=true", then *DEBUG-FLAG* is
set to T.  Otherwise, it defaults to NIL.

The function PARSE-COMMAND-LINE is used to parse the command line and initialize
flags.  It returns the original command line with all recognized flags removed.

The file flag_test.lisp contains many examples.
