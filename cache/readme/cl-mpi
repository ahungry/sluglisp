0. Introduction

CL-MPI is a portable, Common Lisp binding for
the MPI message passing library.
CL-MPI enables parallel programming in Common Lisp
using a message-passing model on either a cluster of machines, or a
single multicore machine.

CL-MPI can also be used to provide "true" multiprocessing for some
Common Lisp implementations which don't have native threading
capabilities.

===================================================
1. PLATFORMS

The long-term goal of CL-MPI is to provide a portable Common Lisp
binding for MPI. I hope that eventually, any Common Lisp
implementation which supports CFFI can be used with any MPI implementation.
In the meantime, here are the currently tested configurations:

Tested MPI implementations:
   - MPICH 1.2.5.3-2  (on Ubuntu Linux 8.04)
   - MPICH2-1.0.8p1   (on Ubuntu Linux 8.04)

Tested Lisp implementations.
   - Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) 1.0.22,1.0.24,1.0.28
   - CMU Common Lisp 19e
   - Embeddable Common Lisp 10.7.1

Successfully tested configurations:
1) MPICH 1.2.5.3-2 on Ubuntu Linux 8.04 (64-bit)with SBCL 1.0.28 (64-bit)
2) MPICH 1.2.5.3-2 on Ubuntu Linux 8.04 with CMUCL 19e
3) MPICH2-1.0.8p1 on Ubuntu Linux 8.04 (64-bit) with SBCL 1.0.28 (64-bit)

In principle, CL-MPI should work with any Common Lisp implementation
supported by CFFI. The above are the only configurations I have tested
so far.

I have also tried OpenMPI 1.3.2 (Ubuntu Linux 8.04) + SBCL 1.0.28.
While CL-MPI appears to build normally, any call to an MPI function
results in a crash.  This may or may not be be related to:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openmpi/+bug/210273
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-numpy/+bug/307901
Since my own projects are currently based on MPICH 1.2 and MPICH2, I
haven't put too much effort into OpenMPI.  Please let me know if you
get CL-MPI working with OpenMPI!



===================================================
2. DEPENDENCIES

   ASDF

   CFFI (C Foreign Function Interface), version 0.10.3 or later
        Tested with CFFI 0.10.4

===================================================
3. INSTALLATION


-------------------
QUICKSTART 
The included Makefile should work if you are using a
standard installation of SBCL (where the sbcl binary is at /usr/local/bin),
and MPICH1.2 installed with apt-get install on a Debian-based system:
or a standard installatin of CMUCL and MPICH
   make asdf-links    <-- creates links to this directory from the standard local
   make test-sbcl
If your configurations differs from the above, or if the above make command doesn't result in the CL-MPI test suite
being executed, then some installation steps may be necessary, so
continue reading!

------------------

a) Install all of the systems which CL-MPI depends on:
  1) Install a supported MPI implementation (currently only MPICH)
  2) Install the CFFI library, version 0.10.3 or later.  

------------------------------------------

b) Configure the installation.

  If your system is already fully configured for compilation
  of C programs, i.e. PATH to mpicc, MPI_LIB and MPI_INCLUDE
  are properly set, no additional configuration is necessary.
  The system also checks some predefined paths.

  (MPI_LIB and MPI_INCLUDE are not necessary if their correct
   values are ../lib and ../include relative to mpicc location)

  Otherwise, you need to edit cl-mpi-configure lisp,
  set values for *mpi-header-file*, *mpi-shared-library*,
  and ensure that the proper feature is pushed.

  If you are using mpich2, you may have to chdir into
  the mpich2-stub directory, and build a helper library
  called libmpiskeleton.so.1.0.1. This library is
  automatically used by the configure file if it exists.

------------------------------------------
c) Build CL-MPI

Start Lisp in the directory where the CL-MPI sources
reside, and build the CL-MPI system:

CL-USER> (asdf:compile-system 'cl-mpi)

Or (suggested if you are using SBCL or CMUCL), there
is a Makefile which can be used in the cl-mpi direcory:

      make test-sbcl
 or   make test-cmucl

With Embeddable Common Lisp this library supports an
alternative way of accessing the MPI libraries, namely
direct linking to them via mpicc. In order to enable
this, you have to push the :mpicc feature before the
asd file is loaded, normally from your .eclrc file:

  (pushnew :mpicc *features*)

You can also add it to the beginning of cl-mpi.asd.

If your installation has only static versions of the MPI
libraries, and cannot create MPI-enabled fasls, you can
use the following commands to build an executable:

  (pushnew :mpicc-static *features*)
  (asdf:compile-system :cl-mpi)
  (asdf:make-mpicc-build <your system> :type :program)

Note that in this mode the system can still be loaded
normally with load-op, but any call to an mpi operation
will result in an error.

===================================================
4. TESTING

After installation is complete, we can try running the CL-MPI test
program, which runs many tests to verify that the library works
correctly.


Do NOT use SLIME or the Lisp implementation's native
REPL to start the test program.  As with all MPI programs, you must
start the MPI environment (e.g., using the standard "mpirun" command)
and execute the Lisp program within MPI.

The exact command to run will depend on your Lisp implementation and
MPI implementation.

  EXAMPLE Commands for running the CL-MPI test suite:

  For SBCL and MPICH:

  Go to the directory where the CL-MPI sources are located, and 
  at the shell prompt, enter:

    mpirun -np 2 /usr/local/bin/sbcl --load "run-mpi-test.lisp"


  The above command starts MPI (with the mpirun executable), using 2
  processes.  Each process starts SBCL (which, in this example, is
  located at /usr/local/bin/sbcl), and SBCL is instructed to load (and
  execute) the test suite (run-mpi-test.lisp).
  You may or may not have to enter the full path to SBCL, depending on
  your environment.

  Similarly, for CMUCL and MPICH, run the command:
     mpirun -np 2 /usr/local/bin/lisp -load "run-mpi-test.lisp"



===================================================
4. DOCUMENTATION/EXAMPLES:


Sorry, not much user-level documentation yet, other than in doc strings and comments.

Before using CL-MPI, it is necessary to be familiar with the MPI programming model.
Here is an excellent MPI tutorial: https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/mpi/



In the cl-mpi/examples directory, there are several examples which
illustrate basic usage, including: a hello world, numerical integration, Mandelbrot set
image generator, and a version of the "GA-based image compression" made
famous by Roger Alsing's "Evolving Mona Lisa" demo.


===================================================
5. NOTES:

** Unfortunately, CL-MPI can not be installed using ASDF-INSTALL
because CL-MPI must be provided the location of the mpi.h header file,
as well as the location of the MPI shared library, and I haven't
figured out how to do this so that it works at least most of the time.
Any patches to make installation easier are welcome!
